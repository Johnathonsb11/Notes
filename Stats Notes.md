## 4.1 - Introduction to Data Collection

### The Statistical Problem-Solving Process

#### 1. **Ask questions** - Clarify the research problem and ask one or more valid statistical questions.

A valid statistical question is based on data that *varies*.

**Examples**:

* **Invalid question** - How much mony does Mr. Tagawa have in his wallet right now.

* **Valid question** - How long can students at your school hold their breath on average.

#### 2. **Collect data** - Design and carry out an appropriate plan to collect the data. 
**Population** - *Entire group* we want the info about.

**Census** - *Collection of data* from each *individual* of the population.

**Sample** - *Subset of individuals* in a *population* that we collect data from.

**Observational Study** - Gathers information about a populatin *without disturbing* the population in the process.

**Experiment** - *Actively imposes* some *treatment* (condition) to measure the response of the population.

#### 3. **Analyze data** - Use appropriate graphical and numerical methods to analyze the data.

#### 4. **Interpret results** - Draw conclusions based on the data analysis and answer questions asked.

## 4.2 - Sampling: Good and Bad

Many statistical studies use information from a sample to make a conclusion about an entire population. To ensure that these conclusions are accurate, we must be mindful of how the sample is selected.

**Bias** - The design of a statistical study shows bias if it is very likely to *underestimate* or *overestimate* the value you want to know.

### Bad Sampling Methods

**Convenience Sample** - A convenience sample consists of individuals from the population who were easy to reach.

**Voluntary Response Sample** - A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose to be in the sample by responding to a general invitation.

### Good Sampling Methods

**Random Sample** - A random sample consists of individuals from the population who are selected for the sample using a *chance process*.

## 4.3 - Sampling and Surveys

Even with proper sampling and questioning practices, other potential biases can be introduced.

**Undercoverage** - Occurs when some members of the population are *less* likely to be chosen or *cannot* be chosen for the sample.

An example of this would be only sampling those that own a land line.

**Nonreponse** - Occurs when an individual chosen for the sample *can't* be contacted or *refuses* to participate.

This can be avoided by following up with those that didn't respond.

**Reponse Bias** - Occurs when there is a *consistent pattern* of *inaccurate* repsonses to a survey question (due to the interviewer).

**Examples**: 
* Asking someone if they think cheerleading is a sport while wearing a cheerleading outfit.
* Wording the question in a confusing way, like using double negatives.

Completely avoiding bias in a survey is impossible, but you can keep it to a minimum using the previous techniques.

A good survey includes:

* Random sampling

* Avoid undercoverage, nonresponse, and reponse bias

* Use a test sample first

## 4.4 - Inference of Sampling

**Simple Random Sample** - A simple random sample of size n is a sample chosen in such a way that every group of n individuals in the population has an *equal chance* to be selected as the sample.

**Sampling Variability** - The fact that different random samples of the same size from the same population produce *different estimates* is called sampling variability.

You can reduce sampling variability by using a larger sample size.

## 4.5 - Observational Studies and Experiments

**Confounding** - Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects on a response variable *cannot* be *distinguished* from each other.

**Control Group** - A control group is a group used to provide a *baseline* for *comparing* the effects of other treatments.

**Placebo Effect** - The palcebo effect describes the fact that some subjects in an experiment will respond favorably to *any* treatment, even an *inactive* treatment.

**Placebo** - A placebo is a treatment that has *no active ingredient*, but is otherwise like other treatments.

**Double-Blind** - In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them and measure the respond variable know which treatment a subject is receiving.

**Single-Blind** - In a single-blind experiment, either the subjects or the people who intereact with them and measure the response variable don't know which treatment a subject is receiving.

## 4.6 - How to Experiment Well

To experiment well, you need groups that are as similar as possible and treated in the exact same way.

If treatments are given to groups that differ greatly, confounding is likely.

To solve this we use random assignment.

**Random Assignment** - In an experiment, random assignment means that treatments are assigned to experimental units or vice versa using a *chance* process.

In order to reduce confounding, bias, and variability even further, we need to *keep all variables similar*, including those that seem unrelated.

## 4.7 - Inference for Experiments

### Completely Randomized Design

> Step 1: Random assignment of n amount of sample.

> Step 2: Divide n evenly into 2 groups.

> Step 3: Give each group their seperate treatments.

> Step 4: Compare the results.

### Statistical Significance

**Statistical Significance** - When an observed difference in reponses between the groups in an experiment is so large that it is *unlikely* to be *explained by chance variation* in the random assignment, we say that the result is statistically significant.

A response is considered statistically significant if it exceeds *5%* of the total amount of reponses.

## 4.8 - Using Studies Wisely

### Inference

**Inference About a Population** - Random **selection** of individuals allows inference about the *population* from which the sample was selected.

**Inference About Cause and Effect** - Random **assignment** of individuals to groups allows for inference about *cause and effect*.

### Data Ethics

Although randomized experiments are the best way to make an inference about cause and effect, in some cases it *isn't ethical to do an experiment*.

#### Basic Principles of Data Ethics

* All planned studies must be *reviewed in advance* by an *institutional review board* charged with protecting the subjects.

    * The board's purpose isn't to decide if a study will produce valuable information, it's only there to protect the subjects.

* All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their *informed consent* before data's collected.

    * Subjects must be *informed in advance* about the nature of the study and any risk it may bring.

    * Subjects must *consent*, or agree, *in writing*.

* All individual data must be kept *confidential*. Only *statistical summaries* for groups of subjects may be made public.

    * The report of an opinion poll may say what percent of the repondents said what.

        * A report may not state what *you* said about the subject.

    * Confidentiality is not the same as *anonymity*. Anonymity means that the *names* of *individuals or director* of the study are *not* known.

## 5.1 - Random, Probability, and Simulation

**Probability** - The probability of any outcome of a chance process is a number between 0 and 1 that describes the proportion of times the outcome would occur in a very large number of repetitions.

**Law of Large Numbers** - The law of large numbers says that if we observe more and more repetitinos of any chance process, the proportion of times that a specific outcome occurs approaches its probability.

The idea of probability is that *randomness* is predictable *in the long run*.

However, it is a myth that future outcomes must make up for an imbalance in outcomes.

**Simulation** - A simulation *imitates* a chance process in a way that accurately models real-world outcomes.

## 5.2 - Basic Probability Rules

**Probability Model** - A probability model is a description of some chance process that consists of two parts: a list of all possible outcomes and the probability for each outcome.

A probability model allows us to find the probability of an event.

**Event** - An event is any collection of outcomes from some chance process.

**Sample Space** - The list of all possbile outcomes is called the sample space.

**Complement Rule** - The complement rule says that 1 - the probability of an event P(A) =  the probability of the events complement P(A^c) / the event that A does not happen.

**Mutually Exclusive** - Two events A and B are mutually exclusive if they have no outcomes in common and so can never occur together. That is if P(A and B) = 0.

**Addition Rule** - The addition rule for mutually exclusive events A and B says that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).

## 5.3 - Two-Way Tables and Venn Diagrams

**General Addition Rule for Two Events** - If A and B are any two events resulting from some chance process, the general addition rule says that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

**Intersection** - The even "A and B" is called the intersection of events A and B. It consists of all outcomes that are common to both events, and is denoted A âˆ© B.

**Union** - The even "A or B" is called the union of events A and B. It consists of all outcomes that are in event A or event B, or both, and is denoted A U B.

## 5.4 - Conditional Probability and Independence

**Conditional Probability** - The probability that one event happens given that another event is known to have happened is called a conditional probability. The conditional probability event B happens given that event A has happened is denoted  by P(B | A).

**Independent Events** - A and B are independent events if knowing whether or not one event has occurred does not change the probability that the other event will happen. In other words, events A and B are independent if P(A | B) = P(A | B^c) = P(A).
Alternatively, events A and B are independent if P(B | A) = P(B | A^c) = P(B).
