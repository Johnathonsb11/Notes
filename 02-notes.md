* **Pass by Value** - A mode that descibes when values are passed to a function, and the function's parameteres recieve a copy of its arguments values.

* **Pass by Reference** - A mode that describes when values are passed to a function, and the function's parameteres recieve its argument's actual value.

* **Event Bubbing and Event Capturing** - These are the ways in which events are propagated in the HTML DOM, which in turn defines the order in which the elements of the DOM recieve the event.

# Working with data in JavaScript

 For any language, we need *variables*, *data types*, *expressions*, and *operators*.

 Satements consists of one or more expressions and/or one or more operators.

```js
let n1 = 100; // A semicolon represents a statement of code.
let n2 = 200;
let n3 = n1 + n2; // Has 2 expressions

// First expression is n1 + n2.
// Second expression is n3 = results of the First expression.

console.log(n3 + (n1 * n2)); // Has 3 expressions

// First expression is n1 * n2.
// Second expression is n3 + results of the first expression.
// Third expression is the log method called on the console.

let n4 = 300; console.log(n4); // 2 statements in one line of code.
```

## Object interaction

### Methods of the window Object:

- [`alert(message)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert)
- [`prompt(messsage, defaultValue)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt)
- [`confirm(message)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm)

### Methods of the document Object:

- [`write(markup - the text to be written)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write)

**Variables** - A named space of memory.

**Data Type** - A definition of the type of information that a variable holds.

## JavaScript Data Types

### Primitive

**`String`** - Any sequence of *alphanumeric characters* written in quotes (either single or double).

```js
let s1 = "hello, world";
```

**`Number`** - Simple *numeric value* written with our without decimals.

```js
let n1 = 100;
let n2 = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211;
let n3 = 15e2;
```

**`Boolean`** - Store one of two values: `true` or `false`.

```js
let b1 = true;
```

**`Null`** - Defines a *value* that *does not exist*.

```js
let null1 = null;
```

**`Undefined`** - The value of a *variable* that's created but has *no value*.

```js
let und1 = undefined;
```

### Non-Primitive

**`Array`** - Special objects that can store *more than one value* at a time.

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; // old school array syntax

nums = new Array(100, 200, 300, 400, 500); // modern array syntax

let grid = [
    [0, 1, 2], // < [0]
    [3, 4, 5], // < [1]
    [6, 7, 8]  // < [2]
//   ^  ^  ^
//  [0][1][2]
]; // 2-dimensional array

/* An array in memory
    Addr  | Value
    0x100 | 1
    0x200 | 2
    0x300 | 3
    0x400 | 4
    0x500 | 5
    0x600 | 6
*/
```

**`Object`** - Data structures that have their *own methods and properties* (values are stored as *name/key value pairs*).

```js
let truck = {
    make: "Chevrolet",
    model: "Silverado 2500HD",
    year: 2006,
    transmission: "automatic",
    color: "white",
    is4WD: true,
}
```

## Variables

### Declaring a variable

- **`var`** - declares a variable that *can* change but is subject to hoisting.
- **`let`** - declares a variable that *can* change.
- **`const`** - declares a variable that *can not* change.

```js
var name = "Johnny";
let name = "Johnny";

const NAME = "Johnny";

// we can change var/let variables like

name = "Tad";

// we cannot change const variables

NAME = "Tad"; // error
```

**Hoisting** - hoisting allows a variable to be used *before* it is declared.

**Hoisting variables is bad!!!**

```js
Color = "red";
var favColor;
```

### Naming variables

Should have *meaningful* and *descriptive* names.

```js
// bad example

let x;
x = document.getElementById("output");

// a good example

let outputElement;
outputElement = document.getElementById("output");
```

JavaScript is *case-sensitive*.

```js
let name; // are seperate variables
let Name;
let NAME;
```

Camel Casing is a good coding principle/practice.

- **lower camelCase** - the first letter is lowercase.
- **upper CamelCase** - the first letter is uppercase.

Variables must start with a *letter*, *dollar sign*, or *underscore*.

```js
// usable names
let outputElement;
let $outputElement;
let _outputElement;
```

**Variable scope** - The scope of a variable is a region in the code from which the variable can be accessed.

```js
// any variables declared outside a function are accessible by all code

let name = "Johnny"; // a global variable - any code can access it

function printName() {
    console.log(name); // this works since name is a global variable
}

// any variables declared inside a function are accessible only inside the function

function sayHi() {
    let msg = "Hello, World!";
    console.log(msg);
}

console.log(msg); // error! msg is local to the sayHi() function
```

## JavaScript Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

The *addition* operator (`+`) returns the result of adding two operands.

```js
x = 25 + 1; // returns 26
```

The *subtraction* operator (`-`) returns the result of subtracting two operands.

```js
x = 25 - 1; // returns 24
```

The *multiplication* operator (`*`) returns the result of multiplying two operands.

```js
x = 25 * 2; // returns 50
```

The *division* operator (`/`) returns the result of dividing two operands.

```js
x = 24 / 2; // returns 12
```

The *remainder* operator (`%`) returns the remainder of dividing two operands.

```js
x = 25 % 2; // returns 1
```

The *Exponentation* operator (`**`) calculates the base to the exponent power, base^exponent.

```js
x = 2 ** 3; // returns 8
y = 10 ** -1; // returns 0.1
```

### Assignment Operators

The *assignment* operator (`=`) assigns the right operand to the left operand.

```js
x = 25;
userId = "T.A.D.";
pi = 3.1415;
```

The *addition assignment* operator (`+=`) adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```js
x = 25;
x += 1;
// x is now equal to 26
```

The *subtraction assignment* operator (`-=`) subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```js
x = 25;
x -= 1;
// x is now equal to 24
```

The *multiplication assignment* operator (`*=`) multiplies the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```js
x = 25;
x *= 2;
// x is now equal to 50
```

The *division assignment* operator (`/=`) divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```js
x = 25;
x /= 2;
// x is now equal to 12.5
```

The *remainder assignment* operator (`%=`) divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the remainder to the left operand.

```js
x = 25;
x %= 2;
// x is now equal to 1
```

### Logical Operators

The *and* logical operator (`&&`) evaluates `true` when **both** operands are `true`.

```js
x = 25;
y = 10;
z = 35;
(x > y) && (y < z); // returns true
(x < y) && (y < z); // returns false
```

The *or* logical operator (`||`) evaluates `true` if **either** operand are `true`.

```js
x = 25;
y = 10;
z = 35;
(x > y) || (y < z); // returns true
```

The *not* logical operator (`!`) evaluates `true` if the operand is `false`, and returns `false` if the operand is `true`.

```js
x = 25;
y = 10;
!(x > y); // returns false
!(x < y); // returns true
```

### Comparison Operators

The *equal* operator (`==`) returns `true` if the operands are equal to each other.

```js
x = 25;
y = 25;
z = 10;
(x == y); // returns true
(x == z); // returns false
```

The ***not*** *equal* operator (`!=`) returns `true` if the operands are **not** equal to each other.

```js
x = 25;
y = 25;
z = 10;
(x != y); // returns false
(x != z); // returns true
```

The *strict equal* operator (`===`) returns `true` if the operands are equal **and** of the same type.

```js
x = 25;
y = 25;
z = "25";
(x === y); // returns true
(x === z); // returns false
```

The *strict ***not*** equal* operator (`!==`) returns `true` if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.

```js
x = 25;
y = 25;
z = "25";
(x !== y); // returns false
(x !== z); // returns true
```

The *greater than* operator (`>`) returns `true` if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

```js
x = 25;
y = 10;
(x > y); // returns true
(y > x); // returns false
```

The *greater than or equal to* operator (`>=`) returns `true` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

```js
x = 25;
y = 25;
z = 45;
(x >= y); // returns true
(z >= y); // returns true
```

The *less than* operator (`<`) returns `true` if the left operand is less than the right operand.

```js
x = 25;
y = 10;
(x > y); // returns false
(y > x); // returns true
```

The *less than or equal to* operator (`<=`) Returns `true` is the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

```js
x = 25;
y = 25;
z = 10;
(x <= y); // returns true
(z <= y); // returns true
```

### Conditional Operator

The *ternary* operator (`? :`) evaluates to one of two different values based on a condition.

```js
// (condition) ? val1 : val2

x = 25;
y = 10;
(x < y) ? true : false;

if (x < y) {
    true;
}
else {
    false;
}

// both do the same thing but the ternary operator is much shorter
```

### Unary Operators

The *unary negation* operator (`-`) returns the negation of its operand. (flips the sign from + to - basically.)

```js
x = 25;
-x; // returns -25
```

The *unary plus* operator (`+`) attempts to convert the operand to a number, if it is not already.

```js
x = "3";
+x; // returns 3
boo = true;
+boo; // returns 1
```

### Increment and Decrement Operators

The *increment* operator (`++`) adds one to its operand. If used as a prefix operator (`++x`), returns the value of its operand **after** adding one. if used as a postfix operator (`x++`), returns the value of its operand **before** adding one. 

```js
x = 25;
x++; // returns 25, sets x to 26
++x; // returns 26, sets x to 26
```

The *decrement* operator (`--`) subtracts one from its operand. The return value is the same to that of the increment operator.

```js
x = 25;
x--; // returns 25, sets x to 24
--x; // returns 24, sets x to 24
```

### Concatenation vs Addition

The `+` operator functions differently based on the data type.

```js
let x = 25;
let y = 25 + 1; // + performs arithmetic addition
let z += 30; // += performs arithmetic addition

let first = "Tad"
let last = "Damitz"
let name = first + " " + last; // + performs concatenation
let fullname = first; // name = "Tad"
fullName += " ";      // name = "Tad "
fullName += last;     // name = "Tad Damitz"
```

## Inline Scripting, Simple User Events, and Basic Event Handlers

### `onload` Event Handler

The onload event is the first event that is fired by the web browser.

```html
<!-- If you were to use inline script (dont do) -->
<body onload="alert('Hello World!');">
```

### `<script>` Locations

All ways you can add a Script to HTML

1. Inline
2. In the `<head>` Element
3. In the `<body>` Element

Inline script should never be used. When scripts are placed in the head, page loading may be deferred (content is loaded after the script) therefore the proper location for loading scripts in an HTML page is at the very bottom of the body element.
